  ## Usage 
  I can connect to a database using Sequelize when I enter schema and seed commands, then a development database is created and is seeded with test data. I enter the command to invoke the application, then my server is started, and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core I get categories, products, or tags. Then the data for each of these routes are displayed in a formatted JSON. I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
